# CSV-Comparison-Tool

The name is a little deceptive but this is a small tool to compare 2 specific CSV exports, One from the spam filter system and another for the active emails on
Microsoft 365. Once ran and files are selected the tool will check for any emails still present on the spam filter csv vs the 365 csv.
Since emails are not automatically removed from the spam filter system once deleted from 365.
